# To access the Home page you have to enter the right emails and passwords.
# You can find these Emails and Password in the file mockUsers.js.
# I used MUI for styling and design.
# I used redux for state management.
# I used axios for handling APIs.
# I used toastify for adding animated alert boxes.
# The only problem was the Pagination. For creating that i needed different endpoints for items which i wanted to show on the screen 
and fake APIs don't have seperate endpoints containing different items.

# In the end,
# I hope you like my simple Reat-Page ;) .
#Good Luck!
